The WMO/CAS OPAG-EPAC Expert Team on [World Data Centres](http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/arep/gaw/world_data_ctres.html)
(ET-WDC) was formally established in 2006 by CAS-XIV [1] but has a history of
activities that dates back to the 1990s. The chair of the ET-WDC is a member
of the OPAG EPAC Scientific Steering Committee (SSC), the steering body of the
[Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW)](https://www.wmo.int/gaw) programme. This expert
team meets every 1-2 years and holds teleconferences 2-4 times per year to
discuss issues of data management, data access, metadata handling and exchange,
data archiving, links to WIGOS and the WMO Information System (WIS), etc.
